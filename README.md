##INTRO NOTES:

- use nvm or n to switch between node versions ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨
- think of React as a view library (i.e. you need a router, styling, build system) lot to do manually/decision making
- Next.js is like a framework framework LOL, app ready framework/fullstack framework
- Lets you build front-end applications and APIs and it uses React as its view library

##NEXT.JS
- several things you can get for free:
- dev build system, routing, pre-rendering, API routes, production build system
