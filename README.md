# NEXT.JS

### INTRO

- use nvm or n to switch between node versions ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨
- think of React as a view library (i.e. you need a router, styling, build system) lot to do manually/decision making
- Next.js is like a framework framework LOL, app ready framework/fullstack framework
- Lets you build front-end applications and APIs and it uses React as its view library

### NEXT.JS
- several things you can get for free:
  - dev build system, routing, pre-rendering, API routes, production build system
- **Create react app**(CRA) is basically boilerplate (doesnt add any new functionality), takes a build system and manage it for you and you can build your app. It's just react no convetions/regular react still have to figure out things like routing.
- **What about gatsby?** more similar to Next.js than CRA. They're very similar. Gatsby has (stronger) conventions built into it i.e. data fetching (content mesh), a lot of overhead you need to know GraphQL to get the best of it. Also Gatsby doesn't have the ability to create API routes.

### WHEN TO USE NEXT.JS?
- Don't make a react app from scratch (takes forever, I know...) unless you use parcel ðŸ˜…
- Do you only need a single page app? Then use **CRA** (no server-side rendering, api routes)
- Do you need a static site like a blog that's also a SPA? Use **Next.js or Gatsby**
- Need SSR (server-side rendering), an API, and all the above? Use **Next.js**

### SETUP
- We have several scripts that we need to declare in package.json: 
  - <code>next</code> Will start Next.js in dev mode with hot reloading.
  - <code>next build</code> Will build your project and ready it for production.
  - <code>next start</code> Will start your built app, used in production.

### ROUTING WITH NEXT.JS
- Don't need to interact with a router directly to create pages. Next.js has built on conventions to make creating routes as easy as creating a file. :D
- To get started create a directory called <code>/pages</code>. Next.js will associate any file in this directory as a route. The file names determine the route name or pattern.
- To create paths like <code>/project/settings</code> we can use folders in our <code>/pages</code> directory. For our note app we need the following routes:
  <code> index => /
  all notes => /notes
  one note => /notes/:id
  </code>
- We already create the index route so lets make a ntoes route 
  <code> pages
            notes
              index.jsx
  </code>
- By adding an <code>index</code> in a folder, we're telling Next.js that we want this component to be the **index route** for this path. So in this case, navigating to <code> /notes </code> will render <code> pages/notes/index.jsx</code>
- 
#### DYNAMIC ROUTING
- Next.js makes it easy to create **dynamic routes**. Depending on if an dhow you want those pages to be **prerendered** will determine how you set them up. We're going to focus on creating dynamic routes that will not be built at build time but rather run time on the server.
- So to create a dynamic route, we can create a file that looks like this: <code>id.jsx</code>
- Where <code>id</code> is the name of the parameter. You can name it whatever you want. Those brackets are not a typoe or placeholder - that's the syntax to create dynamic route using file name conventions.
- We can access the <code>id</code> param inside our page component using <code>useRouter</code> hook from <code>next/route</code> module. This comes for free with Next.js :D
- The param name on the query object is the same name as the param name in the file for that page.

##### CATCH-ALL ROUTES
- There's a beautiful feature in Next.js that allows us to define catch-all routes for when we're too lazy to make a page for each one.
